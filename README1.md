Project Authors: Jamie K. and Thrace S.
Our project titled Collaboration consists of 3 scenes that tell the story of a the life of a chicken.
The first scene contains a chicken in a farm where the main goal is to explore and find a human
The second scene is set in a grocery store where your main goal as a chicken is to collect the 7 rotating seasonings that are placed sporadically around the store, when the seasoning count hits 7, it changes to the third scene.
The third scene sets place at a dinner table that depicts the chicken you have been playing in the first two scenes as a cooked rotisserie chicken. Around the table is 6 dancing chefs doing the chicken dance to end the game. Have fun!
